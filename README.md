# Conveyor System – SolidWorks Design

This project presents the 3D design of an industrial conveyor system developed using SolidWorks.
It includes all mechanical parts of the assembly and technical drawings.

## Project Contents
- **CAD_Files/** – SolidWorks part and assembly files  
- **STEP_IGES/** – Universal 3D format for compatibility  
- **Drawings/** – 2D technical drawings (PDF)  

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks
- SolidWorks Visualize (rendering)

## Features
- Modular conveyor structure  
- Mechanical components designed for industrial use  
- Assembly with realistic proportions  
- Technical drawings with dimensions
